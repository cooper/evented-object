# EventedObject

I doubt your objects have never been this evented. This concept is so incredible that we're using a noun
as a verb without being arrested by the grammar police.  
  
EventedObject started as a basic class in ntirc for registering event handlers and firing events. after being used in ntirc IRC client, Arinity IRC services package, foxy-java modular IRC bot, and other projects, EventedObject has become more complex and quite featureful.  
  
EventedObject supplies an (obviously objective) interface to store callbacks for events, fire events, and more. It provides
several methods for convenience and simplicity.

## History

EventedObject has evolved throughout the history of multiple projects, improving in each project it passed through.
It originated as IRC::EventedObject in NoTrollPlzDev's libirc. From then on, it was found in ntirc IRC client,
Arinity IRC Services, and foxy-java IRC client. The Arinity IRC Services package was the first to use a standalone
EventedObject; before then, it was only packaged with libirc.  
  
Today, EventedObject is found in all many different projects, usually included as a git submodule. A variety
of classes have been written specifically for the EventedObject framework, including a configuration classe,
an evented database interface, an event-driven socket protocol, and more.

## Compatibility notes

EventedObject versions 0.0 to 0.7 are entirely compatible - anything that worked in
version 0.0 or even compies of EventedObject before it was versioned also work in
version 0.7; however, some recent changes break the compatibility with these previous
versions in many cases.  

### Asynchronous improvements 1.0+
  
EventedObject 1.* series and above are incompatible with the former versions.
EventedObject 1.8+ is designed to be more thread-friendly and work well in asyncrhonous
programs, whereas the previous versions were not suitable for such uses.  
  
The main comptability issue is the arguments passed to the callbacks. In the earlier
versions, the EventedObject instance was *always* the first argument of *all* events,
until EventedObject 0.6 added the ability to pass a parameter to `->attach_event()` that
would tell EventedObject to omit the object from the callback's argument list.  
  
### Introduction of event objects 1.8+
  
The EventedObject series 1.8+ passes a hash reference `$event` instead of the
EventedObject as the first argument. `$event` contains information that was formerly held within the object
itself, such as `event_info`, `event_return`, and `event_data`. These are now accessible
through this new hash reference as `$event->{info}`, `$event->{return}`, `$event->{data}`,
etc. The object is now accessible with `$event->{object}`. (this has since been changed; see below.)  
  
Events are now stored in the `eventedObject.events` hash key instead of `events`, as
`events` was a tad bit too broad and could conflict with other libraries.  
  
In addition to these changes, the `attach_event()` method was deprecated in version 1.8
in favor of the new `register_event()`; however, it will remain in EventedObject until at
least the late 2.* series.  
  
### Alias changes 2.0+

Version 2.0 breaks things even more because `->on()` is now an alias for `->register_event()`
rather than the new deprecated `->attach_event()` as it always has been.
  
### Introduction of event methods 2.2+

Version 2.2+ introduces a new class, EventedObject::Event, which provides several methods for
event objects. These methods such as `$event->return` and `$event->object` replace the former hash keys
`$event->{return}`, `$event->{object}`, etc. The former hash interface is no longer supported and will lead to error.

## Event objects

Event objects are passed to all callbacks of an EventedObject (unless the `silent` parameter was specified.) Event objects contain
information about the event itself, the callback, the caller of the event, event data, and more. Event objects replace the
former values stored within the EventedObject itself. This new method promotes asynchronous event firing.

## EventedObject methods

The EventedObject package provides several convenient methods for managing an event-driven object.

### EventedObject->new()

Creates a new EventedObject. Typically, this method is overriden by a child class of EventedObject. It is unncessary
to call SUPER::new(), as EventedObject->new returns nothing more than an empty hash reference blessed to EventedObject.

```perl
my $eo = EventedObject->new();
```

### $eo->register_event($event_name => \\&callback, %options)

Intended to be a replacement for the former `->attach_event`.
Attaches an event callback the object. When the specified event is fired, each of the callbacks registered using this method
will be called by descending priority order (higher priority numbers are called first.)

```perl
$eo->register_event(myEvent => sub {
    ...
}, name => 'some.callback', priority => 200);
```

* __event_name__: the name of the event.
* __callback__: a CODE reference to be called when the event is fired.
* __options__: *optional*, a hash (not hash reference) of any of the below options.

#### %options - event handler options

**All of these options are optional**, but the use of a callback name is **highly recommended**.

* __name__: the name of the callback being registered. must be unique to this particular event.
* __priority__: a numerical priority of the callback.
* __silent__: if true, the $event object will be omitted from the callback argument list.
* __data__: any data that will be stored as `$event->event_data` as the callback is fired.

#### Differences from ->attach_event()

Note: `->attach_event()` by default fires the callback with the EventedObject as its first argument unless told not to do so.
`->register_event()`, however, functions in the opposite sense and *never* passes the EventedObject as the first argument unless the `with_obj` option is passed.  
  
In the 1.* series and above, the event object is passed as the first argument unless the `silent` option is passed. The EventedObject
instance itself is now accessible with `$event->object`.

### $eo->register_events(@events)

Registers several events at once. The arguments should be a list of hash references.
These references take the same options as `->register_event()`. Returns a list of return
values in the order that the events were specified.

```perl
$eo->register_events(
    { myEvent => \\&my_event_1, name => 'cb.1', priority => 200 },
    { myEvent => \\&my_event_2, name => 'cb.2', priority => 100 }
);
```

### Parameters

* __events__: an array of hash references to pass to `->register_event()`.

### $eo->delete_event($event_name, $callback_name)

Deletes an event callback from the object with the given callback name.  
If no callback name is specified, deletes all callbacks of this event.  
Note: If a callback name is not specified in `->attach_event()`, it is impossible to delete the event.  
  
Returns a true value if any events were deleted, false otherwise.

* __event_name__: the name of the event.
* __callback_name__: *optional*, the name of the callback being removed.

### $eo->fire_event($event_name, @arguments)

Fires the specified event, calling each callback that was registered with `->attach_event` in descending order of
their priorities.

```perl
$eo->fire_event('some_event');
```

* __event_name__: the name of the event being fired.
* __arguments__: *optional*, list of arguments to pass to event callbacks.

### $eo->on($event_name, \\&callback, $callback_name, $priority)

Alias for `->attach_event()`.

### $eo->fire($event_name)

Alias for `->fire_event()`.

### $eo->del($event_name, $callback_name)

**Deprecated**. Alias for `->delete_event()`.  
Do not use this. It is likely to removed in the near future.

### $eo->attach_event(...)

**Deprecated**. Use `->register_event()` instead.  
Do not use this. It is likely to removed in the near future.
